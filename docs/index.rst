Introduction
=================
This software package applies a metallicity calibration to low-resolution spectra of RR Lyrae variable stars. The calibration is in the style of Layden 94, but with significant updates.

This online documentation is restricted to the application of the calibration. See paper [...] for details about how the calibration was made, and for further scientific information. 


Installation
=================
You can install it with pip install [...]  Docker and Singularity are options too.


Modules
=================
Documentation of the code itself...
